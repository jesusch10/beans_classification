"Images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains." The project goal is to design and to compare ML algorithms (MLP, SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree) that classify dry beans.
