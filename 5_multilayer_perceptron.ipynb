    "This model considers a wider range of features to obtain the highest possible metrics as it can learn complex patterns and interactions between features, even when some features are not highly informative (highly correlated each other). The ability of MLP to effectively use all features without losing so much performance may be due to its capacity to capture and model non-linear relationships in the data, which simpler models might not handle as well (sensitive to dimensionality). Let's try to create new models eliminating features reducing the metric scores ('ShapeFactor3', 'ConvexArea'), and including or not the features after the eliminated ones that are incrementing again the metric scores, but not higher than the previous best state ('Compactness', 'EquivDiameter', 'Area')."
